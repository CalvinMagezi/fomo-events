                <p class="text-2">FOMO Events is an application designed and dedicated to creating digital jobs for youth within Africa, and hopefully further around the world.</p>
                <p class="text-2">App Users are all welcome to upload and share their events, restaurants, specials and more. Your event will be sorted into your chosen date field. Once your event is uploaded, FOMO hands your events to its Memebers.</p>
                <p class="text-2">FOMO Memebers are a body of individuals working together towards their chosen goals. Members choose the posts that appear in the Recommended Fields, as well as the Spotlight Field. Events put in the Spotlight appear on our Social Media Pages for the world to see. FOMO Members attending Spotlight Events will often have their stories featured in our Instagram Memories of that Event, allowing Spotlight Event Hosts to throwback on their Events through the eyes of different guests.</p>
                <p class="text-2">This App is non data storing, meaning our Events with dates that have already passed are deleted, users and hosts may also request for us to remove any of their events from our social media pages and we shall do so immediately. FOMO Events respects its users privacy and therefore if any user feels their personal information is at too much risk, please contact us at : fomoevents.net@gmail.com</p>
